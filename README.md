Image Processing code for White Dwarf research project

Hello visitor,

These three scripts are the tools I use to process data for an ongoing astronomical research project. 
My project uses the Large Binocular Telescope to directly image planetary systems around White Dwarf Stars. 
An idealized image reduction pipeline is essential to achive maximum sensitivity. For each data set, I 
create a master script that calls upon functions within utilities, pre_process, and process to reduce 
and analyze our data. My pipeline involves basic image reduction as well as methods for high contrast 
imaging. These scripts also utilize tools from the Vortex Imaging Processing (VIP) python package 
(Gomez et al, 2017) for median subtraction and image quality metrics.

Enjoy your visit!
